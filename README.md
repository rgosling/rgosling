My professional focus is on data and analytics as a consultant. I use a myriad of technologies, and tools, but I do focus more on the Microsoft stack. 

When it comes to AI, my work is done on one or more platforms including AzureML, Spark, and Python and can include Synapse Analytics' Spark Engine or Databricks for the same reason. 

I enjoy giving my time to community groups and occasionally - one on one with someone that has an technical issue.

I'm still thinking of writing another book. Stay tuned.
